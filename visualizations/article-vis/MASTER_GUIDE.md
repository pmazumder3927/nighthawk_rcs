## 🔬 Mathematical Concepts Visualized

### 1. **Radar Cross Section Formula**

```
σ = lim(r→∞) 4πr²|Es/Ei|²
```

- **Distance scaling**: 4πr² represents the spreading of electromagnetic energy
- **Field ratio**: |Es/Ei|² compares scattered to incident field strength
- **Effective area**: σ represents the equivalent scattering area

### 2. **Physical Optics Surface Current**

```
J̃s = 2n̂ × H̃i
```

- **Perfect conductor assumption**: Tangential electric field is zero
- **Surface current direction**: Perpendicular to both normal and incident magnetic field
- **Factor of 2**: Accounts for reflected field adding to incident field

### 3. **PO Scattered Field Integral**

```
Ẽs = (jkη/4π) ∫S_lit [k̂s × (k̂s × J̃s)] e^(jk(k̂i-k̂s)·r̃) dS
```

- **Integration over illuminated surface**: S_lit excludes shadowed regions
- **Phase factor**: e^(jk(k̂i-k̂s)·r̃) accounts for path differences
- **Polarization term**: k̂s × (k̂s × J̃s) ensures correct field orientation

### 4. **Detection Distance Relationship**

```
R_detection ∝ σ^(1/4)
```

- **Fourth root law**: Radar range depends on fourth root of RCS
- **Stealth effectiveness**: 100× RCS reduction → 56% detection range
- **Practical implications**: Small RCS improvements yield large tactical advantages
