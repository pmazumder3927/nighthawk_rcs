## Physics Implementation

### Physical Optics (PO) Method

The 3D implementation uses the full vector PO formulation:

1. **Surface Current Calculation**: J_s = 2n̂ × H_i
2. **Scattered Field**: E_s ∝ ∫∫ (k̂_s × (k̂_s × J_s)) e^(jk(k̂_i - k̂_s)·r) dS
3. **RCS**: σ = 4π|E_s|²/|E_i|²

Key features:

- Proper treatment of polarization
- Accurate phase calculations
- Shadow/illumination checking
- GPU-accelerated integration

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
cd nighthawk_rcs

# Run smart setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Quick Test

```bash
# Test installation

# Run 2D demo (fast)
python examples/rcs_optimization_demo.py

# Run 3D demo (GPU recommended)
python examples/rcs_3d_optimization_demo.py
```

## Example Results

### 2D Optimization

- **10-20 dB reduction** in mean RCS
- Natural evolution to faceted shapes
- Validates F-117 design principles

### 3D Optimization

- **15-25 dB reduction** at target angles
- Smooth sphere → faceted polyhedron
- Volume preservation within 5%
- Real-time surface evolution visualization

## Performance Benchmarks

On RTX 4080:

- **Single RCS calculation**: ~0.01s (GPU) vs ~0.1s (CPU)
- **Full optimization (50 iterations)**: ~5-10 minutes
- **RCS pattern (37×73 angles)**: ~30 seconds
- **Memory usage**: <2GB GPU RAM for 10k face meshes

## Key Insights

1. **Faceted Surfaces Emerge Naturally**: Optimization discovers that flat, angled surfaces are optimal for redirecting radar energy.

2. **GPU Acceleration is Crucial**: 3D calculations are computationally intensive; GPU provides 10-100x speedup.

3. **Physics Accuracy Matters**: Proper vector formulation and polarization handling significantly affect results.

4. **Trade-offs Exist**: Optimizing for specific angles can increase RCS at other angles.

5. **Historical Validation**: Results align with known stealth aircraft design principles.

## Educational Value
